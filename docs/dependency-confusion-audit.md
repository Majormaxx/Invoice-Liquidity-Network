# Dependency Confusion and Typosquatting Audit

## Overview

This document provides a systematic audit of the pnpm workspace against dependency-confusion and typosquatting attacks. A monorepo with internal scoped packages is vulnerable if any internal package name can be resolved to an unexpected public package on the npm registry.

## Audit Date

Last Updated: 2026-09-25

## Internal Workspace Package Inventory

The following internal packages are defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `package.json` files across the monorepo:

| Package Name | Scope | Location | Public Registry Status | Protection Status |
|--------------|-------|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| `@iln/sdk` | @iln | packages/sdk | ✅ Published and owned by org | Protected |
| `@iln/shared` | @iln | packages/shared | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@iln/indexer` | @iln | packages/indexer | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@iln/opentelemetry` | @iln | packages/opentelemetry | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@iln/react` | @iln | packages/react | ✅ Published and owned by org | Protected |
| `@iln/test-utils` | @iln | packages/test-utils | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@iln/eslint-config` | @iln | packages/eslint-config | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@iln/mock-backend` | @iln | packages/mock-backend | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@iln/upgrade-tests` | @iln | packages/upgrade-tests | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@invoice-liquidity/sdk` | @invoice-liquidity | sdk/ | ✅ Published and owned by org | Protected |
| `@invoice-liquidity/cli` | @invoice-liquidity | cli/ | ✅ Published and owned by org | Protected |
| `@invoice-liquidity/docs` | @invoice-liquidity | docs/ | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@invoice-liquidity/docs-next` | @invoice-liquidity | packages/docs | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `@invoice-liquidity/notifications` | @invoice-liquidity | notifications/ | 🔒 Reserved (unpublished) | Protected |
| `iln-indexer` | (unscoped) | indexer/ | ❌ Not published | ⚠️ Requires scoping |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **`iln-indexer`** (unscoped): This package name is not scoped and not published to npm. An attacker could register this name on npm, and depending on resolution order, pnpm might resolve it to the public package instead of the workspace package.
  - **Mitigation**: Rename to `@iln/indexer-service` or publish a placeholder to reserve the name.

### Medium Risk
- **Unpublished scoped packages**: While the `@iln` and `@invoice-liquidity` scopes are owned by the organization, unpublished package names within those scopes are not explicitly reserved on npm. If scope ownership is compromised or transferred, these names could be registered by an attacker.
  - **Mitigation**: Publish placeholder packages (version 0.0.0 with README noting they are reserved) or use npm organizations access controls to prevent unauthorized publishing.

### Low Risk
- **Published and owned packages**: These are actively published and owned by the organization's npm account, providing strong protection against confusion attacks.

## pnpm Workspace Resolution Analysis

### Workspace Protocol

pnpm resolves workspace packages using the `workspace:` protocol in `package.json` dependencies:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@iln/shared": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

This ensures local workspace packages are always resolved from the monorepo, not from npm registry.

### Lockfile Analysis

The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file has been audited for unexpected external resolutions of internal package names:

```bash
# Check for external resolutions of internal packages
grep -E "@iln/|@invoice-liquidity/|iln-indexer" pnpm-lock.yaml | grep -v "workspace:" | grep -v "link:"
```

**Findings**: No unexpected external resolutions detected as of audit date.

### Dependency Graph Verification

All internal package references use the `workspace:` protocol, ensuring they cannot be hijacked by external packages:

```bash
# Verify all internal dependencies use workspace protocol
pnpm list --depth 0 --json | jq '.[] | .dependencies | to_entries | .[] | select(.value | startswith("workspace:"))'
```

## Attack Vectors and Mitigations

### Attack Vector 1: Unscoped Package Name Registration

**Scenario**: Attacker registers `iln-indexer` on npm with malicious code.

**Exploit Condition**: If `iln-indexer` is referenced without `workspace:` protocol or if pnpm resolution order prioritizes external registry.

**Mitigation**:
1. Rename unscoped packages to scoped equivalents
2. Publish placeholder to reserve name
3. Use `.npmrc` to restrict scope resolution

### Attack Vector 2: Typosquatting Similar Names

**Scenario**: Attacker registers packages with names similar to internal packages (e.g., `@il

n/sdk`, `@iln/shred`, `@invoice-liquiditty/cli`).

**Exploit Condition**: Developer typo in import or package.json leads to installing malicious package.

**Mitigation**:
1. Code review for dependency additions
2. Automated typosquatting detection in CI
3. Dependency lock enforcement

### Attack Vector 3: Scope Hijacking

**Scenario**: Organization npm account is compromised, allowing attacker to publish to `@iln` or `@invoice-liquidity` scopes.

**Exploit Condition**: Weak npm credentials, no 2FA, or social engineering of npm support.

**Mitigation**:
1. Enforce 2FA on all npm organization members
2. Use granular access tokens with publish-only permissions
3. Monitor npm audit logs for unexpected publishes
4. Use npm provenance with GitHub Actions OIDC

## CI Enforcement Script

A new CI check has been added to detect unexpected external resolutions:

```javascript
// scripts/check-dependency-confusion.mjs
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { resolve } from 'path';

const INTERNAL_SCOPES = ['@iln', '@invoice-liquidity'];
const INTERNAL_UNSCOPED = ['iln-indexer'];

function checkDependencyConfusion() {
  const lockfile = readFileSync(resolve(process.cwd(), 'pnpm-lock.yaml'), 'utf-8');
  const errors = [];
  
  // Check for external resolutions of internal packages
  for (const scope of INTERNAL_SCOPES) {
    const scopePattern = new RegExp(`${scope}/[^:]+:`, 'g');
    const matches = lockfile.match(scopePattern) || [];
    
    for (const match of matches) {
      // Extract package name
      const pkgName = match.replace(':', '');
      
      // Check if it's an external resolution (not workspace: or link:)
      const resolutionLine = lockfile.split('\n').find(line => 
        line.includes(pkgName) && !line.includes('workspace:') && !line.includes('link:')
      );
      
      if (resolutionLine && resolutionLine.includes('registry.npmjs.org')) {
        errors.push(`Unexpected external resolution for internal package: ${pkgName}`);
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Check unscoped packages
  for (const pkg of INTERNAL_UNSCOPED) {
    if (lockfile.includes(`${pkg}:`) && !lockfile.includes(`${pkg}: link:`)) {
      errors.push(`Unscoped internal package ${pkg} may be vulnerable to confusion attack`);
    }
  }
  
  if (errors.length > 0) {
    console.error('Dependency confusion vulnerabilities detected:');
    errors.forEach(err => console.error(`  - ${err}`));
    process.exit(1);
  }
  
  console.log('No dependency confusion vulnerabilities detected.');
}

checkDependencyConfusion();
```

      - name: Verify workspace protocol usage
        run: |
          echo "Checking all internal dependencies use workspace: protocol..."
          ! grep -r "\"@iln/" packages/ --include="package.json" | grep -v "workspace:"
          ! grep -r "\"@invoice-liquidity/" packages/ --include="package.json" | grep -v "workspace:"
```

## NPM Registry Configuration

The `.npmrc` file has been updated to enforce scope ownership:

```
# .npmrc
@iln:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
@invoice-liquidity:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
save-exact=true
engine-strict=true
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Audit completed** - All internal packages inventoried
2. ⚠️ **Rename or publish** `iln-indexer` to prevent unscoped confusion
3. ✅ **Add CI check** - Automated detection in place
4. ✅ **Document findings** - This report serves as the security note

### Short-term Actions (Within 30 days)

1. Publish placeholder packages for all unpublished scoped packages
2. Enforce 2FA on all npm organization members
3. Implement npm provenance with GitHub Actions OIDC
4. Add typosquatting detection to CI (check for similar package names)

### Long-term Actions (Within 90 days)

1. Periodic re-audit (quarterly) of workspace package inventory
2. Automated monitoring of npm registry for suspicious packages
3. Team training on dependency confusion attack vectors
4. Establish incident response plan for compromised dependencies

## Incident Response

If a dependency confusion attack is detected:

1. **Isolate**: Remove the malicious package from lockfile immediately
2. **Assess**: Determine if the package was installed in production
3. **Audit**: Check git history and CI logs for when it was introduced
4. **Rotate**: Rotate all secrets that may have been exposed
5. **Notify**: Alert team and npm security if a typosquat was registered
6. **Mitigate**: Implement additional controls to prevent recurrence
